# Intro 


We, Metalamp team, have been developing blockchain services for more than 5 years. We already have a roadmap for frontend and backend developers, which we consider quite successful (link to the roadmap, screenshot with stats on saves, forks and views).

Now we've decided to create a roadmap for a different audience - people who want to work in the web3 space, but don't know where to start.

Who our roadmap might be useful for:

HRs - to have more conscious interviews with web3 developers
PMs - to speak the same language with their developers and understand how the world of decentralized finance works
Sales Managers - to better understand leads on pre-sales and to form a perfect commercial offer
Marketing managers - to better promote their team's services on the market and find the ideal target audience
Editors, copywriters - to create relevant content for specialized sites with knowledge of the topic
and many other enthusiasts who want to become part of the wonderful new world of web3
