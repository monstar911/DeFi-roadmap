# Intro 


We, Metalamp team, have been developing blockchain services for more than 5 years. We already have a roadmap for frontend and backend developers, which we can consider quite successful (link to the roadmap, screenshot with stats on saves, forks and views).

Now we decided to create a roadmap for a different audience - people who want to work in web3, but don't know where to start. 

Who our roadmap might be suitable for:
- HR - to have more informed interviews with web3 developers
- PM - to speak the same language with their fellow developers and understand how the world of decentralized finance works
- Sales Manager - to better understand leads on pre-sales and to form a perfect commercial offer
- Marketers - to better promote their team's services on the market and find the ideal target audience.
- editors, copywriters - to develop relevant content for specialized sites with knowledge of the topic
- and many other enthusiasts who want to become part of the wonderful new world of web3
